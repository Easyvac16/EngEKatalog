        "review_text": "This iPhone 14 replaces my iPhone 11. Please note that I am a long time user of Apple products from the first day those years ago when i was introduced to Apple's desktop computer that looked like something from outer space and everything had to be programmed into it. I love Apple products. Apple products are the best of the best and soo easy to use and if I come up with a problem that I cannot fix, all it takes is a quick message to Apple's wonderful support team. This new Apple Series 14 phone that I just got from Verizon replaces my iPhone Series 11 phone. I really do like this new phone. It is much thinner and lighter in weight than the Series 11 Phone which means that it takes up lesser space in my purse. When I go for my walks the Series 14 phone fits so much better in my pocketed belt that I wear and the lighter weight makes the belt much more comfortable. I have small hands and because of the slimmer size the phone fits nicely in my hands and this is important. Yesterday when out walking, I received a call from my Granddaughter some 2000 miles away. It was nice to be able to hold the phone comfortably in my hand as we talked. And the reception was excellent.....so clear and faultless and my Granddaughter sounded as if she was there walking along beside me as she talked. Then, the Series 14 phone has some new features to explore and enjoy.\n\nThank you Verizon for offering to your customers such a quality phone for signing up for your phone service. I am so grateful for the new phone. I am going to really enjoy my new phone service and this new phone. You are so appreciated.",
